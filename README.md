# ResumeParser
With the emergence of Job portal's like Linked-In, Indeed, Zip-Recruiter, Hire, etc. , job searching has become more convenient. The portals allow the job seeker to find all relevant jobs at one place. The job portals provide job seekers with easy-apply, apply via link \& email to the recruiter type of facilities. These enable the job seeker to apply for many jobs in quick time which resulted in getting many applications for a single job posting. The companies shortlist candidates by parsing their resumes to match with job-specific criteria. The companies find it difficult to parse \& extract the candidate's information due to the presence of different resume structures. Only those candidates get shortlisted whose resume is correctly parsed \& which satisfy the job-specific criteria. Further, The job seekers fail to understand why their resume not getting shortlisted. Also, job seekers find it hard to identify whether the resume has all keywords (i.e. skills, experience, qualification, etc.) \& does it meet the job description criteria which could be due to the content or format of the resume. This project focuses on extracting candidate information from its resume which is in PDF format. A Hybrid technique was used content-based & layout-based techniques for resume parsing. The hybrid approach uses a blend of rule-based and segmentation-based techniques for effective resume parsing.
